# Gradient Boosting

<body>
  How it works:

The model begins by making a very basic prediction, such as the average price of all houses.
Learn from mistakes: It looks at where the initial guess was wrong and trains a small model (a "weak learner") to correct those errors.
Repeat and improve: It adds more small models, each one focusing on fixing the errors of the combined previous models. Over time, it gets better and better at making accurate predictions.
